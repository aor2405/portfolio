              I graduated from college in 2014 with a degree in electronic
              engineering. Although I started my career in engineering, I also
              had an interest in web and software development. With this
              interest, I continued to study web dev in my spare time and
              continued to grow my skills over the years. I made the transition
              from working as a senior technical support engineer to a software
              developer in May 2021.

              Outside of software development, my biggest passion in life in
              Basketball. I have played semi â€“ professionally basketball for the
              past 5 years and been awarded the role of team captain for 3 of
              those years. I helped lead my team to the highest league in
              Ireland, where we competed in the past season.
